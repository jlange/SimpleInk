Windows 8 Inking Application
============================

This is a simple Windows 8 application that uses event driven ink rendering on 
an SVG "canvas". Very simple used mostly for testing purposes. Also incluedes a 
simple recognition function that splits recognition results based on where 
inking occurs, (the rectangle boxes).
